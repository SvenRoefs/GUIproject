How to run GUIproject

Step 1:
Download the recommended version from https://nodejs.org/en/ and install the program.

Step 2:
Create a folder in which you want to work.

Step 3:
Start Command Prompt and navigate to the created folder (or type 'cd ' and drag and drop the created folder into the command prompt).
Make sure you are working on the right drive (e.g. C instead of D, this is not always correct by default).
Type: 'npm init'.
Fill in the asked questions (tutorial, version, description, etc.) or leave empty.

Step 4:
Type: 'npm install electron' and wait for it to be installed.
There should now be a node_modules folder and a package.json file in the selected folder.
Delete this package.json file.

Step 5:
Copy the GUIproject files (including the new package.json file) into the selected folder (not into the node_modules folder!).
Run the program by typing 'npm start' in the command screen.
Note: one should still have navigated to the selected folder first before typing 'npm start'.
